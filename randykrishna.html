            <h4>Randy Krishna's Tandoori Steakhouse</h4>
            <div class="description">During Summer 2015 while I interned at <a href="http://luckypeach.com/" target="_blank"><i>Lucky Peach</i></a>, I had the opportunity to work on the branding for <a href="http://ny.eater.com/2015/9/18/9354165/randy-krishnas" target="_blank">Ruth Krishna's Tandoori Steakhouse, which had to be changed to Randy Krishna's Tandoori Steakhouse (lol)</a>. I worked on everything from the logo to the menus to the web promotions and all in between under the direction of <a href="http://garphicdesorgn.com/">Walter Green</a>. I looked at the Ruth Chris's Steakhouse as inspiration and Indian imagery. I took an South Asian art history class, and I remember being in awe at Jali, perforated patterns that are common in India. I wanted to incorporate that with a bold, sort of corporate looking typeface. This was such an exciting project to be a part of, and I learned a lot throughout the process.<br><br>
